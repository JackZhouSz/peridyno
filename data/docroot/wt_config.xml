<!--
    Wt Configuration File.

    The Wt configuration file manages, for every Wt application, settings
    for session management, debugging, directory for runtime information
    such as session sockets, and some security settings.

    Settings may be specified globally, or for a single application path.

    The path should be as configured in the Wt build process, where it
    defaults to /etc/wt/wt_config.xml. It can be overridden in the environment
    variable WT_CONFIG_XML, or with the -c startup option of wthttp.

    The values listed here are the default values, which are used when the
    declaration is missing or no configuration file is used.

      The special location "*" always matches. See below for an example
      of settings specific to a single application.

            <!-- Every session runs within a dedicated process.

               This mode guarantees kernel-level session privacy, but as every
               session requires a separate process, it is also an easy target
               for DoS attacks if not shielded by access control.

               Note: currently only supported by the wtfcgi and wthttp
               connectors.

               max-num-sessions determines the maximum number of sessions

               num-session-threads determines the number of threads for every
               session process. If not specified, the number of threads for every
               session process is the same as the number of threads for the parent
               process.

            <!-- Idle timeout (seconds).

               When the user does not interact with the application for the set number of seconds,
               WApplication::idleTimeout() is called. By default, this
               method quits the application immediately, but it can be overridden
               if different behaviour is desired.

               This feature can be used to prevent others from taking over a session
               when the device that the Wt application is being used from is left behind,
               and is most effective in combination with a fairly short session timeout (<timeout>)

               When omitted, or left empty, this feature is disabled.

            <!-- Server push timeout (seconds).

               When using server-initiated updates, the client uses
               long-polling requests. Proxies (including reverse
               proxies) are notorious for silently closing idle
               requests; the client therefore cancels the request
               periodically and issues a new one. This timeout sets
               the frequency.

    <!-- Override settings for specific applications.

       Location refers to physical filesystem location of the
       application. The application prints this location (which
       corresponds to argv[0]) to the log file on startup, and this
       should match exactly.
